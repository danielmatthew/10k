## What?

A fun way to discover Last.fm's trending tracks for its entire userbase, and for a particular user. This project was originally created during August 2011 as an entry to A List Apart's '10k Apart' competition. It's fair to say that we missed that deadline.

## Todo
- [] Allow user to swap between tracks, albums, and artists 
- [] Add dynamism to albums: swoosh out from centre position
